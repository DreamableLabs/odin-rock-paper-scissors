# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors using JavaScript. The game is played in the browser console, where the user can play a single 5-round game against the computer.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that loads the game.
- `js/scripts.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Open the browser console (usually accessible with `F12`, `Ctrl+Shift+I`, or `Cmd+Option+I`).
3. Follow the prompts in the console to input your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
4. The game consists of 5 rounds. After each round, the winner is determined, and the score is updated.
5. After 5 rounds, the game displays the overall winner based on the number of rounds won.

## Game Logic

- The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors for each round.
- The user inputs their choice via the console.
- The winner of each round is determined based on the standard rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
- The game keeps track of the score for both the user and the computer.
- After 5 rounds, the game displays the final result.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project locally:

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Open the console and start playing the game.
